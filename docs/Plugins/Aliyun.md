# How To Use the Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud) DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [Aliyun (Alibaba Cloud)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/dns) DNS provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and registered the domains or zones you will be working against.

## Setup

First, login to your account and go to the [Security Management](https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak) page. Click the `Create Access Key` link and make a note of the Key ID and Secret values.

!!! note
    It is also supported recommended to use RAM (Resource Access Management) users with more limited privileges instead of your root account key. More information about creating RAM users can be found [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/28625.htm).

## Using the Plugin

The Key ID is specified as a string using `AliKeyId` and the secret is specified as a SecureString using `AliSecret`.

!!! warning
    The `AliSecretInsecure` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the next major module version. If you are using it, please migrate to the Secure parameter set.

```powershell
$secret = Read-Host "Secret" -AsSecureString
$pArgs = @{
    AliKeyId = 'asdf1234'
    AliSecret = $secret
}
New-PACertificate example.com -Plugin Aliyun -PluginArgs $pArgs
```
